## Welcome to My GitHub Pages

Hello
My name is Aiswarya C . I am currently pursuing my B.Tech degree in Computer Science from MES College of Engineering. I am interested in doing creative designing. 

WHAT IS FABLAB ??? 

FABLAB is a 3D fabrication lab that has been recently set up at our college. It is completely amazing considering the possibilities of turning imagination to reality. It consists of a lot of machines such as the 3D printer, CNC, laser cutter/engraver and others too. I am in the process of diving into the depths of knowledge of how we could turn one’s imagination to reality. Actually this seems no less than magic. Atleast that is how I feel. So, here I am to share my experience at FABLAB, MESCE. I hope that anyone who goes through this will get an idea about the technology used in a 3D fabrication lab. Well … explore and have fun.
