# DAY 2: INTRODUCTION TO SOFTWARES USED

Following are some of the softwares used for designing purpose

## CURA

* This is a 3D printing software.
* This software is used for converting the stl file into gcode.
* Here we can specify the strength and durability of the materail.
* And also the time ultimaker will take to print the design will also be shown.



## 123D SOFTWARE

* 123D Design uses a simple and intuitive graphical user interface that places your toolbox on the top and the view tools right beneath it, with the design area taking the rest of the space. 
* The icons of the toolbox items are very indicative of their functionality, and they spawn items list when clicked. 
* The approach of placing something in the design area is not the usual “drag n drop” but the more convenient “click and place”.
* Drag and drop may be used later to refine the position of an item though, but that is camera-dependent as it works with vertical and perpendicular vectors. 
* By clicking the item after its placement, you can change its properties (height, length, etc).
